# CINEWATCH
A CRUD application used to manipulate a database containing movie-related information. Frontend was implemented with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, and backend with Node.js and JawsDB.

# Features
- Supports Create, Read, Update and Delete operations, allowing users to add/update/delete movies, theatres, actors, genres, awards, and their relationships.
- Contains a search/filter feature for movies, allowing users to search movies by name, genre, awards won and more.

# Requirements
None. Live version of application can be found here: https://cine-watch.herokuapp.com/

# Known Bugs
None. If you experience issues with seeing or manipulating the data it is likely because of limitations with the free database being used (i.e. max number of concurrent connections reached).

# Credit
Co-developed with Rachel Orrell (https://github.com/rorrell), who created the pages for actors and genres and formatted the file structure of repo.
